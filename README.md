## Competitive Coding Repository 
This repository contains some useful codes, techniques, *algorithms*, *data structures* and problem solutions helpful in Competitive Coding.

### Problem Solutions
The solutions to various problems in different contests or practice problems on the following sites are available:
- [Codeforces](Problem%20Solutions/Codeforces/)
- [Code Chef](Problem%20Solutions/CodeChef/)
- [Google Code Jam](Problem%20Solutions/CodeJam/)
- [Hacker Earth](Problem%20Solutions/HackerEarth/)
- [Hacker Rank](Problem%20Solutions/HackerRank/)
- [Top Coder](Problem%20Solutions/TopCoder/)
- [UVa Online Judge](Problem%20Solutions/UVa%20Problems/)
- [CS Academy](Problem%20Solutions/CSAcademy/)

### Algorithms
1. [Graph Algorithms](Algorithms/Graphs/)
2. [Number Theory Algorithms](Algorithms/NumberTheory/)
    - [Primality Tests](Algorithms/NumberTheory/primalityTests/)

### Data Structures
Yet to be implemented: [Data Structures](Data%20Structures) 

### Template for Contests
Some tricks and templates will be available soon: [Templates](Templates/)

### How to contribute
1. #### Algorithms
- Choose a algorithm of that you wish to implement.
- In the [Algorithms](Algorithms/) folder, if you don't find a suitable folder in which category this algorithm belongs, then create that folder, otherwise go to the existing one.
- Create a separate folder inside it with the name of the Algorithm. 
- Add your file, commit and send a pull request. 

2. #### Data Structures
- Choose a Data Structure that you wish to implement.
- In the [Data Structures](Data%20Structures/) folder, if there is already a folder for this DS then go to that, otherwise create the folder.
- Add your file, commit and send a pull request.

3. #### Problem Solutions
Similarly, find the right folder in [Problem Solutions](Problem%20Solutions) folder where this solution should belong to, if doesn't exist, then create it and add the solution. Commit and send a pull request.
